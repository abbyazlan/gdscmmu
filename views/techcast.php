                    ~ Launcher, a space launch startup, experienced a setback with its Orbiter mission when it lost contact with the spacecraft due to solar array pointing issues.
                    ~ Despite the loss of contact, Launcher remains hopeful and will continue efforts to establish communication in case the spacecraft can recharge its batteries.
                    ~ Launcher has identified the likely cause of the communication failure and is working to address it.
                    ~ Along with Launcher's Orbiter, several customer payloads were on board, including cubesats from Innova Space and TRL11, a startup focused on developing video applications for space.
                    ~ Launcher's Orbiter mission, named SN3, is actually the second launch for the company, following a failed mission (SN1) earlier in January due to power system issues.
                    ~ Launcher plans to conduct its third Orbiter mission in February 2024, followed by two additional flights during the same year.
                    ~ Vast, a space station company founded by Jed McCaleb, acquired Launcher in February of this year. The financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
                    ~ TechCrunch has reached out to Launcher for further comment and will update the article if a response is received.
                    ~ The article has been updated to include comments from Starfish, a company associated with the mission, and to clarify that torque rods rely on Earth's magnetic field for operation.
